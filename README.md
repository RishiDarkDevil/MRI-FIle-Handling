# Reading MRI File
Here in this Notebook I have used the **NiBabel** Python Package to read the NIfTI File(.nii) which was created using dcm2niix utility available for Anaconda Distribution of Python.\
DICOM Files were converted to NIfTI File and then it was read in Python into a 3D-matrix for the Image along with several attributes associated with the File, Like the Dimension, Affine Marix, etc.\
Useful comments are been made in each cell to make it clear what are we doing. I made this when I was trying to learn about reading MRI Files(.nii) in Python. This step is very useful, as what follows next is analysis of the Images using several other ML and Statistical Techniques.
